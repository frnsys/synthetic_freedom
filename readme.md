# Outline

- layout landscape (see below)
- collectively system-map all the influences/causes and downstream effects of automation/AI
    - ideal outcomes: lots of discussion & a comprehensive system map
- develop a game (or series of games) exploring the mapped system

# Readings

- a more general perspective on potential of AI: <http://www.milesbrundage.com/blog-posts/how-far-to-ai-topia>
- on social perception/self-identifying value of work/jobs: <https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/02/work-it/>
- on the human/environmental cost of technology production: <http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150402-the-worst-place-on-earth>

# Landscape/touchpoints

- what is automation? broadly: when technology replaces a human
    - automation as distinct from AI, though AI will contribute to the acceleration of automation
        - e.g. traps as automation
        - keurig k-cups/vending machines
        - turbotax
- automation and the death of manufacturing

# System mapping

Areas to consider:

- global trade/geopolitics
- education
- transportation (e.g. self-driving cars, private/public transit)
- manufacturing/production
- immigration/globalization
- etc
